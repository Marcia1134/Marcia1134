# Marcia 
I am a 16 year old Python developer based in Malaysia. I am working my way through IGCSES and currently aiming for A-Levels. I enjoy development as a hobby and have been infactuated with computers and computing for many years. I am exploring my way through AI however I currently lack the hardware to do that efficently. 

## What languages do I work with?
> Python <img src="https://github.com/Marcia1134/Marcia1134/assets/149586712/5679d06b-a0fc-4e84-885c-b3e57727b4bd" width="15" height="15"> </img> </br>

## What are my future plans with this account/coding in general?
I would love to start developing products that make some money, even relatively small amounts of money for me it right now, it is more about the princable then anything. I could use the money to support my development, further education, or hardware.
